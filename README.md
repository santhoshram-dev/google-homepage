Hi,

It's been 2 months since I have started taking full-stack developer course in OdinProject. With help of the articles provided, I have finished learning basics
of HTML and CSS. I haven't mastered all the codes and tags in HTML and CSS, but with proper practice I will see myself a well-learnt HTML and CSS coder. Taking 
the next step on OdinProject to clone GOOGLE page. will update the achievements in the near-future. Until then, Good Luck!
